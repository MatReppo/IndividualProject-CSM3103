                <p class="description"> The kimchi fried rice was delicious and the toppings allowed on the dish were fresh and good in terms of quality. I would recommend this place because this restaurant allows a lot of flexibility to how you want your dish to be. You get to pick the type of rice, the type of meat, and the additional toppings that you want.</p>

                <p class="description">The mango noodle was good! The overall taste of the dish was decent and it definitely met my expectations of what this dish should taste like. The portion size was a bit small, but the size still seemed pretty fair. The restaurant offered many food choices and the restaurant was pretty clean.</p>

                <p class="description">The bento box was a bit small. I was expecting a little bit more food in the bento box but it tasted pretty good. This is a dish I would not prefer if you are hungry and looking for a full meal. However, the restaurant itself was good. It was clean and had a welcoming environment.</p>
